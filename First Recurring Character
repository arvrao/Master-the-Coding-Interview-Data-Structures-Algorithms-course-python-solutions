Find the first recurring character or number in a given list:

We can leverage dictionaries concept.
Create empty dictionary, iterate through the list, check condition if given character exists as key, then return the character. Else if it doesn't exist, 
then initialize the value as 0.
def recurlst(lst):
    d = {}
    for num in lst:
        if num in d:
            return num
        
        else:
            d[num] = 0
    return '\0'

lst = [1,2,3,4,5,2]
print(recurlst(lst))
